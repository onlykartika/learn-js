HTML provides the structural foundation for web content, defining elements like text, images, and links. CSS complements HTML by handling visual aspects such as layout and design. Together, they enable developers to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. As you explore functions, the Document Object Model (DOM), and decision-making in your repository, you're gaining the skills to manipulate HTML dynamically and enhance the interactivity of web applications.
